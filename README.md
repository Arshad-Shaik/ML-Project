# ML-Project - Student Performance Prediction System
"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR TRACKING AND PREDICTING STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN DEGREE PROGRAMS"

# üéì Student Performance Prediction System
A comprehensive **Machine Learning desktop application** built with **Python and Tkinter** designed to track, analyze, and predict student academic performance in degree programs. This system leverages ensemble learning techniques to provide accurate GPA predictions and personalized course recommendations, aiding educational institutions in proactive student intervention.

## üìñ Situation-Task-Action-Result (STAR Method)

*   **Situation:** Educational institutions face challenges in identifying at-risk students early and providing personalized academic guidance to improve retention and success rates in degree programs.
*   **Task:** To design and develop an intelligent, data-driven software solution that can accurately predict student performance based on academic and behavioral features, and provide actionable recommendations for courses and interventions.
*   **Action:** 
    *   **Engineered** a robust machine learning pipeline using a **UCLA student dataset**, performing comprehensive data preprocessing including label encoding and normalization for 10+ categorical features.
    *   **Developed and compared** multiple predictive models including **Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression**, and a **novel Ensemble-based Progressive Prediction (EPP) algorithm** using Bagging with Decision Trees.
    *   **Designed and implemented** an intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter, allowing educators to upload data, train models, visualize results, and generate individual student predictions seamlessly.
    *   **Integrated** a recommendation engine that suggests optimal future courses based on predicted GPA scores, mapping outcomes to over 30 distinct career paths and specializations.
*   **Result:** Successfully delivered a fully-functional desktop application that demonstrates the effective use of ensemble machine learning for educational analytics. The system provides educators with a powerful tool to predict student performance with low Mean Squared Error (MSE), enabling early intervention and personalized academic planning to improve student outcomes.

## üîç How the Prediction System Works

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** The system takes a dataset of student features (e.g., self-learning capability, certifications, workshops attended, talent tests, reading/writing skills, memory score, interested subjects). Categorical features are encoded using Label Encoding, and the entire dataset is normalized.
2.  **Model Training:** The preprocessed data is split into training and testing sets. Multiple classifier algorithms are trained and evaluated.
3.  **Ensemble Prediction:** The proposed EPP (Ensemble-based Progressive Prediction) algorithm, which uses a Bagging classifier with Decision Trees as the base estimator, makes the final predictions by aggregating the results of multiple models.
4.  **Performance Prediction & Course Recommendation:** For a new student's data, the system predicts a performance score. Based on this score, it recommends whether the student is likely to achieve a High or Low GPA in a new course and suggests a suitable future course from a predefined list of specializations.
